# Code Finder

Part of a [build2learn project](https://github.com/dorait/b2lideas/wiki/Code-Assistant) aiming to build an intelligent code assistant. This project provides a simple backend API server to search, analyse, track and catalog code on behalf of the user. Users will interact with this program using a browser plugin or a code editor plugin. I'll add in a link to that repo when its available.


## TODO

 - [ ] Setup the project wiki
 - [ ] Setup project tasks to be done
